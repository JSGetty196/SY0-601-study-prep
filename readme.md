# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) Notes

These are personal notes I took and helped pass the Security+ exam. 
Feel free to use them in any way they help you.

These Notes were taken during studying **Jason Dion's** course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/) and so all the explanations and terms you will find in the notes are taken from Jason's course.

Also check his website for voucher discounts and other training material as well as pracitce tests [Jason Dions's Website](https://www.diontraining.com/)

All files come in multiple formats(pdf, docx, md). If you find anything wrong in my notes don't hesitate to reach me and I will try to fix asap ;)

## Note
These notes follow Dion's course content. __**BUT** there maybe be few objectives not covered in depth or at all__. As you will see, the notes don't follow the offical exam material. But rather summarize key subjects you should be aware of.  

So it's __adviced to take the course or any other official study material__ (other courses and books ) and use these notes as an extra help to understand/memorize and go back to look an refresh your memory. __You should not rely only on these notes for passing the exam.__

I can recommend few books for study material and practice exam tests:
1) [Official study guide](https://www.comptia.org/training/books/security-sy0-601-study-guide)
2) [Mike Chapple-Study Guide SY0-601 8th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Study-Guide-SY0-601/dp/1119736250/)
3) [David Seidl-Practice Tests SY0-601 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Practice-Tests-SY0-601/dp/1119735467/)
4) [Jason Dion's Practice tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/security-601-exams/)
5) [Professor Messer's Practice Exams SY0-601](https://www.professormesser.com/sy0-601-success-bundle/)

PS: I used practice exam questions also to study by going back and studying the explanations on questions I wasn't sure. Best tactic IMHO.
